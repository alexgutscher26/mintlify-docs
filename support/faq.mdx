    **For professionals:** Use GPT-4 or Claude 3 Opus for highest quality responses.
    
    **For high volume:** Use Claude 3 Haiku or GPT-3.5 Turbo for speed and cost efficiency.
    
    You can configure multiple providers and switch between them as needed.
  </Accordion>

    No, AI API keys are required to generate replies. However, you can:

## AI & Reply Generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my generated replies not good quality?">
    **Common causes and solutions:**
    
    **Insufficient context:**
    - Ensure the original post has enough content for context
    - Try adding custom instructions for better guidance
    
    **Wrong model selection:**
    - Use GPT-4 or Claude Opus for complex content
    - Switch models if current one isn't performing well
    
    **Inappropriate tone:**
    - Match tone to the platform and context
    - Experiment with different tone options
    
    **Generic prompts:**
    - Add specific instructions in the context field
    - Provide more details about your role or perspective
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I make replies sound more like me?">
    **Personalization strategies:**
    
    1. **Edit generated replies** - Always review and modify to match your voice
    2. **Use custom instructions** - Add guidelines like "Write from a startup founder perspective"
    3. **Choose appropriate tone** - Select the tone that matches your usual communication style
    4. **Add personal touches** - Include your own experiences or insights
    5. **Learn from patterns** - Notice which edits you make frequently and adjust instructions
  </Accordion>

    **Via API:**
    - Use the `variations` parameter in your API request
    - <b>Note:</b> API endpoints are not meant to be visited directly in a browser. Use POST requests from your application or tools like Postman or curl, and include the required headers and body.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Compare different approaches
    - Choose the best option for context
    - Learn what works best for your audience
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do some replies get flagged or rejected?">

    1. **Inappropriate content** - AI models have built-in safety filters
    2. **Platform violations** - Content that violates social media guidelines
    3. **Spam detection** - Overly promotional or repetitive content
    4. **Context misunderstanding** - AI misinterpreted the original post
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Try regenerating with different instructions
