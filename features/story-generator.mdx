## Best Practices

- **Keep it Concise**: Stories are meant to be quick and engaging - keep text brief
- **Visual First**: Focus on strong visual elements with supporting text
- **Create a Narrative Arc**: Build a story with a beginning, middle, and end
- **Use Interactive Elements**: Incorporate polls, questions, or sliders when possible
- **Maintain Brand Consistency**: Ensure your stories align with your overall brand identity
- **Call to Action**: Include a clear call to action in your stories
- **Platform Considerations**:
  - **Instagram**: 15-second segments, vertical format (9:16), interactive stickers
  - **Facebook**: Similar to Instagram but with different audience expectations
  - **Snapchat**: More casual and playful content typically works best
  - **LinkedIn**: More professional tone and business-focused content
