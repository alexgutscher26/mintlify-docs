## Usage Examples

### Professional LinkedIn Reply

<CodeGroup>

```text Original Post
"Just launched our new product after 2 years of development. The journey was challenging but incredibly rewarding. What's the longest project you've worked on?"
```

```text Generated Reply (Professional Tone)
Congratulations on your launch! üéâ Two years is a significant commitment that shows real dedication. I recently completed a 3-year digital transformation project that taught me the value of persistence and iterative improvement. The challenges often become the most valuable learning experiences. Wishing you great success with your new product!
```

</CodeGroup>

### Casual Twitter Reply

<CodeGroup>

```text Original Post
"Coffee shops that don't have WiFi passwords written anywhere are the worst üò§"
```

```text Generated Reply (Casual Tone)
The struggle is real! üòÖ Nothing worse than ordering your coffee and then having to do the awkward "what's the WiFi password?" dance with the barista. Some places just want to watch the world burn ‚òïÔ∏èüî•
```

</CodeGroup>

### Supportive Facebook Reply

<CodeGroup>

```text Original Post
"Having a tough week at work. Sometimes it feels like nothing goes right üòî"
```

```text Generated Reply (Supportive Tone)
I hear you - those weeks can be really draining. Remember that tough periods don't last, but resilient people like you do! üí™ Sometimes taking a step back and celebrating small wins can help shift perspective. You've got this, and better days are ahead! üåü
```
