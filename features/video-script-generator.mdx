## Best Practices

- **Start with a Hook**: Capture attention in the first 3-5 seconds
- **Keep it Concise**: Be clear and direct with your messaging
- **Consider Platform Norms**: 
  - TikTok/Instagram Reels: Fast-paced, entertaining, often with trending sounds
  - YouTube: More detailed, can include longer explanations
  - LinkedIn: Professional tone, focus on value and insights
- **Script for Visuals**: Include notes about what should be shown on screen
- **Use Simple Language**: Write how you speak, not how you write
- **Include Timestamps**: Mark sections of your script with approximate timing
- **Plan for Edits**: Write slightly more content than needed to allow for editing flexibility
- **End with Clear CTA**: Tell viewers exactly what you want them to do next
